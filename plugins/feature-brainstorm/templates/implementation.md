## Current Phase
Phase 1

## Phases

### Phase 1: Issue Discovery
- [ ] Fetch parent issue from Linear
- [ ] Parse DAG from description
- [ ] Fetch child tasks
- [ ] Build dependency graph
- **Status:** in_progress

### Phase 2: Task Assessment
- [ ] Identify ready tasks (no unfinished dependencies)
- [ ] Launch task-assessor agents in parallel
- [ ] Categorize tasks (autonomous vs approval)
- [ ] Document assessments
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 3: Parallel Implementation
- [ ] Build execution queue (topological sort)
- [ ] Implement autonomous tasks in parallel (max 3)
- [ ] Get approval for complex tasks before implementing
- [ ] Track completion and unlock dependents
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 4: Quality Review
- [ ] Launch code-reviewer agents
- [ ] Identify issues by severity
- [ ] Present findings to user
- [ ] Address critical issues
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 5: Summary
- [ ] Update all Linear issues to Done
- [ ] Generate completion summary
- [ ] Present to user with Linear URLs
- **Status:** pending

## Task Assessments

### Task N: [Title]
- **Size:** S/M/L
- **Confidence:** High/Medium/Low
- **Classification:** Autonomous / Approval Required
- **Rationale:** [why this classification]
- **Suggested Approach:** [implementation steps]
- **Relevant Files:** [files to modify]
